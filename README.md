# Regression - House Price Prediction using Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)

This repository contains a regression project focused on predicting housing prices. The project contains Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and the implementation of neural network models for predictions.

## Data Source

The dataset for this project is from Kaggle's [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) competition.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `eda-and-initial-data-processing.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and initial data preprocessing. 
- `fnn_modules/`: Custom Python modules for neural network modeling, training, testing, and pipeline creation.
- `regression-model-training.ipynb`: Training and evaluating various FNN models.
